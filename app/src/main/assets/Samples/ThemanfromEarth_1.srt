00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,060
hey, buddy

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,910
you don't waste time, do you?

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,070
I try not to
you don't waste time, do you?

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,650
I try not to

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,650
Hey, you need help?

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,680
sure

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,950
would you like to tell us what the hell that was all about ?

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,550
I don't like goodd-byes

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,550
Kind of the point of a good-bye party, John

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,380
Went to a certain amount of trouble, you know ?

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,570
could've at least stayed a few minutes, huh ?

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,580
Eaten some of the food we so feverishly prepared ?

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,580
I apologise , Harry

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,220
But why are you moving so quickly?
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,770
you got the history chair at Stanford.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,800
I wish.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:49,980
Well, taquitos, chicken wings, Roastie-Toasties and beer.
I wish.

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,120
Well, taquitos, chicken wings, Roastie-Toasties and beer.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,640
If we'd had more time, we'd have done something a little more grandiose.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,210
Candlelight dinner at McDonald's. Strippers.

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,210
Taquitos are fine.
